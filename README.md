# Skill Picker Reborn
A superior choice for organizing camp skills

An app for macOS that manages and organizes a camp's campers, leaders and activites. Designed to be better.

# Supported macOS Versions
Supports macOS Ventura and up (macOS 13+).

# Downloads
**Select the "Releases" tab on the right side of the page to get a download!** The app should work for both Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (ARM) Macs.

# Status
**Active development.** Currently being worked on as a side project with more improvements being added, so I don't really have much of a hard schedule for when this will be 100% complete, but I am aiming for the end of this summer.

# Contributing
If it makes the app work better, look better, or run faster, I will accept any pull requests.

# Windows?
No. <sup><sub>(Ok, maybe, if enough people ask. But not right now.)</sub></sup>
