# Skill Picker Reborn
A superior choice for organizing camp skills

An app for macOS that manages and organizes a camp's campers, leaders and activites. Designed to be better.

# Supported macOS Versions
Supports macOS Ventura and up (macOS 13+).

# Downloads
**None yet.** Once app gets into a usable state, downloads will be added.

# Status
**Pre-alpha testing phase.** The app is not in a state to be used right now. Currently being worked on as a side project, so I don't really have much of a hard schedule for when this will be complete, but I am aiming for the end of this summer.

# Contributing
If it makes the app work better, look better, or run faster, I will accept any pull requests.

# Windows?
No. <sup><sub>(Ok, maybe, if enough people ask. But not right now.)</sub></sup>
