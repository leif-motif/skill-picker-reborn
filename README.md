An app for macOS that manages and organizes a camp's campers, leaders and activites.

Supports macOS Ventura and up (macOS 13+). Skill Picker Reborn should support both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM) Macs.

# Download and Installation

2. Unzip the app. Optionally, you may move it to your Applications folder.
3. Attempt to run the app. You should get some sort of error complaining that the app is from an unidentified developer.

# Status
**Active development.** Currently being worked on as a side project with more improvements being added, so I don't really have much of a hard schedule for when this will be 100% complete, but I am aiming for the end of this summer.

# Bugs, Suggestions and Contributing
If you come across any bugs in the app, have any requests, suggestions or criticisms, open an issue on this page and I will try and address it when I can. I will accept any pull requests if it makes the app work better, look better, or run faster.
